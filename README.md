### About
According to the 2021 bureau of labor statistics report, 25% of the turnover rate seen within the labor market
is due to voluntary turn over. As a general rule employee retention rates of 90% or higher are considered good, and a 
company should aim for a turnover rate of 10% or less. 

For this exploration we have uncovered the top 10 correlative factors for Attrition and Monthly Income for the hypothetical
company FritoFlay. 
*A futher analysis of the processes and finding can be found in the Attrition Project Repo.*
